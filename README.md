# CSC465: NYC restaurant inspection group project choropleths

## Description
In this exploratory data visualization project, we created various viz using R for variables found in the New York City Restaurant Inspection Results dataset. For my portion, I created choropleths visualizing the number of incidences of restaurant inspection violations across different NYC boroughs and zipcodes and from year 2014 to 2017 using R's Shiny package.
